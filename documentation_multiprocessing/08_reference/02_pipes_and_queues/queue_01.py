"""
Returns a process shared queue implemented using a pipe and a few locks/
semaphores. When a process first puts an item on the queue a feeder thread is 
started which transfers objects from a buffer into the pipe.

The usual queue.Empty and queue.Full exceptions from the standard 
libraryâ€™s queue 
module are raised to signal timeouts.

Queue implements all the methods of queue.Queue except 
for task_done() and join().
"""

"""
qsize()
	Return the approximate size of the queue. Because of multithreading/
	multiprocessing semantics, this number is not reliable.

	Note that this may raise NotImplementedError on Unix platforms like Mac OS X 
	where sem_getvalue() is not implemented.
